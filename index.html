        <h2>Mentorship Program</h2>
        <p>The program connects peers before college starts, allowing high school students to build rapport through meetings arranged at their convenience, often led by FGLI student volunteers. It includes a two-week immersive pre-college summer session with insights from FGLI students on financial and student affairs, followed by a week of personalized activities during the standard orientation. Additionally, there's a focus on essential college tech skills and a practical "adulting" course taught by advisors, featuring alumni speakers and tailored advice sessions. While open to all, the program especially supports FGLI students, providing a comprehensive foundation for their college journey.</p>
